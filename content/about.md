title: About Me
---

My name is Alphoncina Lyamuya, I usually go by Allie. I'm passionate about
learning, researching, and working with data. I'm curious by nature, therefore,
diving into new projects and trying to find answers to complex tasks is where I
often like to put my head into. I also enjoy learning from people and sharing my
insights with others, which is part of why I decided to create this website.

I'm currently pursuing a Master in Public Policy and Administration as well as a
graduate certificate in Data Analytics and Computation Social Science at the
University of Massachusetts in Amherst, USA. I hope to continue to pursue my
passion in learning and researching in the next phase of my career.

Please feel free to contact me about my work, potential collaboration in
projects, or any other related aspects.
